# clothing-lite

This is supposed to be an application hosted on a device which when given the pictures of any clothing belonging to the 10 categories of clothing it has been trained on, would detect the category of the clothing. 

The trained model was supposed to be converted to a tf-lite model using TF-Lite but I was facing some issues which I might resolve later to deploy it as an application that works in real time.
